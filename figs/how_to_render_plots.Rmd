```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
#Create folder to save in [main=plots/subfolder=200, filename]
ragg::agg_png(here::here("plots/2000", "testplot.png"))
    dev.off()
    
#OR
    
library(here)
ggsave(filename = here("figs","fig1.png")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
